# Simple Movie List

- In This Lab We will build an interactive web page, focusing on event listeners and event handlers....
- We’ll practice more vanilla JS DOM manipulation by creating a simple Movie List project.
- By Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the interface interactive.
- Users should be able to type in a movie title and click ‘add’ to add a movie onto the list.
- Clicking on the movie’s title should cross it off. Clicking the ‘x’ button next to the title should remove the movie from the list.
- We’ll also be making a dynamic notification.
